This is the repository for the [https://archeagetools.github.io/GoodsCalculator/](https://archeagetools.github.io/GoodsCalculator/) ArcheAge calculator. The goal of this calculator will initially be to simply do a depth-first evaluation of all of the required components (labor, materials, gold, etc) to create a crafting good. e.g to make a Tier 3 potion, it would be the potion base plus the mats required for each step.

Eventually, it would be nice to compare multiple "routes" to similar crafting items, or to calculate the most gold- and/or labor-efficient task to perform to sell goods.
